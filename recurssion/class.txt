slicing:
 [start:stop:step]

 Ex:
 a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(a[::2]) for finding the odd number in the list

print(a[::1]) for finding the even numbers in the list

a = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
print(a) => this is using loops in lists


Given a list of words, generate a list of their lengths.
Given a list of words, generate a list of their first letters.
Given a list of words, generate a list with each word converted to uppercase.
Given a string of mixed characters, generate a list of digits present in the string.
Given a string, generate a list of vowels present in the string.
Given a list of words, generate a list of words that are longer than three characters.
Given a list of words, generate a list with each word reversed.



# Given a list of words, generate a list of their lengths.

# Given a list of words, generate a list of their first letters.
f_l=[f[0] for f in words]

# Given a list of words, generate a list with each word converted to uppercase.
to_upper=[word.upper() for word in words]

# Given a string of mixed characters, generate a list of digits present in the string.

# Given a string, generate a list of vowels present in the string.
str = 'hello'

list = [l for l in str.lower() if l in vowels]
print(list)


# Given a list of words, generate a list of words that are longer than three characters.
word=[word for word in words if len(word)>3]
print(word)


# Given a list of words, generate a list with each word reversed.
reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
